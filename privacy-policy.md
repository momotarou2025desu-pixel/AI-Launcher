1. Information We Collect

AeonAIView does not collect, store, or transmit personal information such as your name, email address, phone number, precise location, device identifiers, or contact data.

2. What the App Does

AeonAIView is a launcher that opens the AI service website you select in an external browser of your choice (e.g., Chrome, Microsoft Edge, or Firefox).

Login status, cookies, browsing history, and any account-related data are managed by:

the external browser you use, and

the third-party AI service website you visit.

3. Third-Party Services

When you open a website from AeonAIView, you are interacting with third-party services. Those services may collect and process data according to their own privacy policies.
Please review the privacy policies of the websites and the browser you use.

4. Permissions

AeonAIView does not request sensitive permissions such as access to contacts, location, phone, SMS, microphone, or camera.

If future versions introduce features that require additional permissions, this policy will be updated and the purpose of such permissions will be clearly disclosed.

5. Analytics and Advertising

AeonAIView does not use analytics SDKs (e.g., Google Analytics, Firebase Analytics) and does not display ads.

If analytics or advertising is added in the future, this policy will be updated to reflect those changes.

6. Data Storage

AeonAIView does not store user login credentials or user content.
The app may store minimal local settings (e.g., UI preferences) that do not identify you personally.

7. Children’s Privacy
