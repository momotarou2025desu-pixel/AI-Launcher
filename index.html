AI Launcher Privacy Policy
Last updated: 2026-01-19

1. What AI Launcher does
AI Launcher is a launcher app that helps you open selected AI service websites in an external browser (such as Chrome, Microsoft Edge, or Firefox).

AI Launcher does not provide its own login system. Login status, cookies, browsing history, and any content you enter on those websites are handled by the external browser and the third-party websites you visit.

2. Advertising
AI Launcher may display ads and may use third-party advertising services (such as Google AdMob / Google Mobile Ads SDK).

3. Information we collect
AI Launcher does not require you to create an account and does not directly collect personal information such as your name, email address, or phone number.

AI Launcher does not collect or store your website login credentials or your chat content on our servers.

4. Information handled by ad providers
When ads are shown, third-party advertising services used in the app may automatically collect, use, and share certain information for ad delivery, measurement, improvement, analytics, and fraud prevention. This information may include:
- IP address (which may be used to estimate general location)
- Advertising ID and other device identifiers
- App activity and ad interactions (e.g., app launches, ad impressions, taps/clicks)
- Diagnostics and performance data (e.g., crash logs)

5. How the information is used
The information described above may be used for:
- Displaying and delivering ads
- Measuring ad performance (impressions, clicks, and where applicable, conversions)
- Analytics and service improvement
- Detecting, preventing, and addressing fraud or abuse

6. Data sharing
We do not sell your personal information.

Ad-related information may be shared by advertising providers with their partners as part of ad delivery, measurement, analytics, and fraud prevention, in accordance with their privacy policies.

7. Your choices
- You can reset or delete your Android Advertising ID in your device settings.
- You can manage ad personalization and related privacy controls in Android and Google settings.
- You can review and manage device permissions and privacy settings at any time.

8. Permissions
AI Launcher does not request sensitive permissions such as access to contacts, phone/SMS, microphone, camera, or precise location.

If future versions require additional permissions, we will update this policy and explain why those permissions are needed.

9. Third-party websites and services
Websites opened from AI Launcher are third-party services. Their data practices are governed by their own privacy policies.
Please review the privacy policies of the websites you use and the external browser you choose.
